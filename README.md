# Bidding War

A web app for facilitating streaming marathon bidding wars.

## Still Taking Shape

This is still very much a work in progress. Feel free to chip in some code!

## Future Features

Allows participants to put money toward various types of marathon goals:

* Save/Kill the animals
* Unlock an event at a certain money amount
* Slench Pizza, bid on what toppings will go on a pizza the streamers will order
* Name a character/save file/painting

Streamers can incorporate data and displays directly into their streams.

Bidding War does not itself collect payments, but it can associate bids with
payments made through other payment processors.
